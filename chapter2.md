title       : The Standardized Vocabularies
description : During this part of the course we will be studying the OHDSI Standardized Vocabularies by running queries against the SYNPUF CDM we loaded on a SQL Server instance in the Microsoft Azure cloud (if you have obtained access). Alternatively, you could use your own CDM instance for these exercises. <p><b>Instructions on how to connect to our CDM are provided during the face-to-face course.</b>

## Introduction

In the figure below you see the so-called entity-relationship diagram highlighting the tables within the Standardized Vocabulary section in the CDM. This diagram illustrates how field in the tables are connected to each other. In each table you see a number of 'keys'. A 'red' key means that this is a so-called 'primary key', i.e. each value is unique and is used to reference the data. A 'green' key is a 'foreign key' which means it links to a primary key in another table, e.g. the foreign key vocabulary\_id in the concept table refers to the primary key in the vocabulary table. The 'blue' keys represent primary keys that consists of multiple fields, i.e. the combination of these fields is unique and used to lookup data in the table.
These constraints are enforced in a relational database to ensure the data integrity.

In the table below you can find a description of the tables we will discuss in more detail in this course (marked in green boxes in the figure above):
| Table  | Description |
|---|---|
| CONCEPT | Contains all the terminologies. The key is a newly created concept\_id, not the original code of the terminology.  | 
| CONCEPT_ANCESTOR | Chains of hierarchical relationships are recorded in the CONCEPT\_ANCESTOR table. Ancestry relationships are only recorded between Standard Concepts that are valid (not deprecated) and are connected through valid and hierarchical relationships in the RELATIONSHIP table (flag defines\_ancestry) |
| CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP | Records in the CONCEPT\_RELATIONSHIP table define semantic relationships between Concepts. Such relationships can be hierarchical or lateral. 
| VOCABULARY | The VOCABULARY table includes a list of the Vocabularies collected from various sources or created de novo by the OMOP community. This reference table is populated with a single record for each Vocabulary source and includes a descriptive name and other associated attributes for the Vocabulary. |

More detailed information about the data model can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki/" style="color:black">Github Wiki</a>

We will ask you to run a number of queries to train you in using these tables. You should have received seperate instructions on how to connect to our simulated database containing the latest vocabulary and data of 1000 patients (SYNPUF1000), or you can use your own CDM if you have access to it during the course.

As you can see in the table above the concept\_ids in the CONCEPT table are not the original code of the terminolgy. Why are we not using the original SNOMED concept\_id if we use SNOMED as our standard for Conditions?

*** =possible_answers

- The ids are long and will take unnecessary space in the CDM
- We think we can make better codes
- [Other terminology systems may have the same code]
- We perform a quality control step that requires new code assignment

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks

- This will have no major effect on the CDM size
- Definitely not, we value the effort done by others and re-use this as much as possible
- Correct. You will see some examples later on in the course
- We do perform quality control steps but this is not the reason for defining our own codes.

## Your First Query

First, have a look at the fields in the <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki/CONCEPT" style="color:black">CONCEPT table</a>. 
Then run your first query against the CDM to find the concept\_name of concept\_id = 313217:

```
SELECT * 
FROM concept 
WHERE concept_id = 313217;
```

What is the correct answer?


*** =possible_answers

- Asthma
- [Atrial Fibrillation]
- Stroke
- Death

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks

- Check your query
- You did you first query against the Vocabulary
- Check your query
- Check your query

## Search by concept_code

In the previous exercise we searched for a concept by its 'OMOP' concept\_id. Another option to find a concept is to use its source code, e.g. the code provided by SNOMED.

It is important to understand that a concept\_code is not unique. Try to run this query to see for yourself:

```
SELECT * 
FROM concept 
WHERE concept_code = '1001';
```

Let's have a look at the Atrial Fibrillation example we used earlier if this is also true in that case. Run this query:

```
SELECT * 
FROM concept 
WHERE concept_code = '49436004';
```

What is the vocabulary\_id of this concept?

*** =possible_answers
- [SNOMED]
- ICD-9
- DPD
- RXNORM

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- Note that the vocabulary\_ids are available in readable format! 
- Check your query
- Check your query
- Check your query

## Vocabulary Table
The VOCABULARY table includes the list of the included Vocabularies. This reference table is populated with a single record for each Vocabulary source and includes a descriptive name and other associated attributes for the Vocabulary.
Have a look at the fields in the <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki/VOCABULARY" style="color:black">VOCABULARY table</a>. 


Run the following query to see the content of this table:

```
SELECT * 
FROM vocabulary
```

Which of the following statements is not true:

*** =possible_answers

- The vocabulary\_id=None shows the version of the vocab that is loaded
- [OMOP does not invent new concepts but is only using concepts from other terminology systems]
- The RxNorm Extension Vocabulary contains clinical drugs not on the American market
- The current list of vocabularies is not final

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- This is correct, have a look in the table
- This is indeed the incorrect answer, we do add concepts for example for the domains because these are not available from other terminology systems
- This is correct. RxNorm Extension is very actively being extended to cover for example all European drugs
- This is correct, for example, more source vocabularies are added in Europe.

--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:sql xp:50 skills:1 key:c91862a449
## Search by concept_name

Normally you do not know these concept values by heart and you like to search by concept\_name.
This can be done in several ways as illustrated below.

A. Extract by full name. Run the query below to see the results.

```
SELECT * 
FROM concept 
WHERE concept_name = 'Atrial fibrillation';
```
Note that this is case-sensitive. If you are not certain you could use LOWER:

```
SELECT * 
FROM concept 
WHERE LOWER(concept_name) = 'atrial fibrillation';
```
B. Search using 'like'. You can easily search for all the concepts that contain a substring using wildcards (%):

```
SELECT * 
FROM concept 
WHERE LOWER(concept_name) like '%fibrillation%';
```

 Let's try to find the standard concept\_id for the clinical finding Asthma in the vocabulary. Try to find this using both methods described above. You will see that if you do not restrict to the concept\_class\_id = 'Clinical Finding' (AND concept\_class\_id = 'Clinical Finding') you can get multiple standard concepts!
 
 What is the code we asked for?

*** =possible_answers
- 195967001
- 257581
- [317009]
- 45877009
*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- This is not the field we asked for!
- This exacerbation of Asthma
- Well done. We will learn how to extract the different types of Asthma later in the course
- This is the answer to a question located in the measurement table.

## Concept Relationship (1)

Records in the CONCEPT\_RELATIONSHIP table define semantic relationships between Concepts. Such relationships can be hierarchical or lateral.
The figure below shows the concept relationships for the condition domain.

<center><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/hierarchy1.png" alt="Concept Relationship" width="550" height="400"></center>

This shows that all non-standard vocabularies map to the Standard SNOMED vocabulary at different levels. The figure also shows the MEDRA vocabulary which is used for a higher 'Classification' level (denoted as 'C' in the standard\_concept field in the concept table).

There are different types of relationships defined in the vocabulary. For example the 'Maps to' relationship defines to witch Standard Concept\_id the codes maps to. You can explore all the relationships by running the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM relationship;
```

Let's use this new insight to find to which standard concept\_id the code '427.31' is mapped to. You can do this for example by first finding the concept\_id using:
```
SELECT * FROM concept WHERE concept_code = '290.4';
```

You can then use the concept_relationshop table find its relationships.

```
SELECT * FROM concept_relationship WHERE concept_id_1 = <fill in the concept_id>;
```
Check you understand what the Subsumes and Is a relationships are of this concept\_id.

What is the concept\_id it maps to?
*** =possible_answers
- 44824105
- 44821811 
- [443605]
- 44831079

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- this is not the Maps to concept\_id
- this is not the Maps to concept\_id
- Correct. Well done.
- this is the concept\_id of the source code


--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:sql xp:50 skills:1 key:6db04cb9b6
## Concept Relationship (2)

In the figure below you see three concept\_codes for three different source vocabularies. Can you figure out to which concept\_id these map?

<center><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/mapaf.png" alt="Atrial Fibrillation" width="450" height="300"></center>

*** =possible_answers
- 313217
- [313217, 4154290]
- 4154290
- 443605

*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- Are you sure the figure is actually correct?
- Indeed, the ICD10-CM code will rollup to 313217 through the hierarchy though.
- No that is not right, check your query.
- No that is not right, check your query.

## Concept Relationship (3)
It is kind of annoying that when you do query you only see concept\_ids. Fortunately, SQL is much more powerful than we have discussed so far You can do a so-called join to link two tables. There are different types of joins but we will here only explain the often used inner-join. What does this mean? 

<center><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/innerjoin.png" alt="Inner join" width="650" height="230"></center>

On the left you see two tables with three rows, e.g. the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table and the CONCEPT Table. What we do with the inner join is it matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal. The 'magic' is that in your result set you can use fields of both tables. Try the following query and see what happens:

```
SELECT cr.relationship_id, c.* 
FROM concept_relationship cr 
JOIN concept c ON cr.concept_id_2 = c.concept_id 
WHERE cr.concept_id_1 = 313217;
```

That is really awesome and very handy!

How many concept_ids have the relationship 'Mapped from' to the standard concept\_id of 'Vascular Dementia'? Try not to manually count but think of a query to find this number.

*** =possible_answers
- 4
- 6
- [13]
- 9

*** =hint
In SQL you can use count() as follows:
```
SELECT count(relationship_id)
FROM concept_relationship
WHERE concept_id_1 = 443605
```

*** =feedbacks
- Wrong answer
- Wrong answer
- Correct. Did you use count()?
- Wrong answer

## Concept Ancestor (1)
Chains of hierarchical relationships are recorded in the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table. Ancestry relationships are only recorded between Standard Concepts that are valid (not deprecated) and are connected through valid and hierarchical relationships in the RELATIONSHIP table. So what does this really mean?

<center><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/ancestor.png" alt="Inner join" width="650" height="380"></center>

The figure shows for the concept Atrial fibrillation the different hierarchical relationships. A concept has descendants (more specific) and ancestors (more general), for example Heart Disease is an ancestor of Atrial Fibrillation and is separated by 4 levels. This hierarchy is very powerful since it allows you to automatically include all the descendants if you build a cohort of people.

You could use the CONCEPT\_RELATIONSHIP table to traverse to the hierarchy but the queries for this are quite complicated and may take a long time to run. The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observational analysis by providing the complete hierarchical relationships between Concepts. It contains the relationships with all the parents of concept.

Have a look at the fields in the <a href="https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki/CONCEPT_ANCESTOR" style="color:black">CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table</a>. 

So how can we use this? The query below finds all the ancestors of Atrial fibrillation, try to run it.

```
SELECT max_levels_of_separation, c.* 
FROM concept_ancestor ca, concept c
WHERE ca.descendant_concept_id = 313217 /* Atrial fibrillation */ 
	AND ca.ancestor_concept_id = c.concept_id 
ORDER BY max_levels_of_separation
```

Can you now create a query to find al the descendants of Heart Disease? Do you expect the number of returned concept_ids to be the same as in the previous query?

*** =possible_answers
- yes
- [no]
*** =hint

*** =feedbacks
- Is Atrial Fibrillation the only type of Heart Disease?
- Correct. There are many more type of Heart Disease.

## Concept Ancestor (2)

Now let's do a final bit more tricky question. I am looking for the standard concept\_id for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
What is the correct concept_id?


*** =possible_answers
- [4291649]
- 4000610
- 4201745
- 4332645

*** =hint
You can use %like% or use the hierarchy to find the correct concept\_id

*** =feedbacks
- well done.
- is this the correct level in the hierarchy?
- is this the correct level in the hierarchy?
- is this the correct level in the hierarchy?

## Drug Hierarchy (1)

How do the drugs fit in the Standardized Vocabularies? In the same way, drugs have also different types of source vocabularies, they have different hierarchical levels, and relationships.
The figure below shows this in a bit more depth.

<center><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/drughierarchy.png" alt="Drug Hierarchy" width="650" height="430"></center>

As you can see the source vocabularies, e.g. Multilex role up to the standard terminology system RxNorm at different levels. Here there are several classification systems, e.g. ATC.

The search for specific drugs we use the exact same tables as we have used before.

Can you find the concept\_id of the active compound Warfarin by keyword in the vocabulary?

*** =possible_answers
- [1310149]
- 40772658
- 21600975
- 45618204

*** =hint


*** =feedbacks
- Correct!
- This is not an ingredient
- This is not an ingredient
- This is not an ingredient

--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:sql xp:50 skills:1 key:0b2aca79c5
## Drug Hierarchy (2)

As for the conditions you can also use the CONCEPT\_RELATIONSHIP table to find standard concept\_ids.

Can you find the concept\_class\_id of the standard concept that 'Maps to' Bristol Meyer Squibb's  Plavix 75mg capsules: NDC 67544050474?


*** =possible_answers
- Ingredient
- Substance
- [Branded Drug]
- Chemical Structure

*** =hint
First find its concept\_id and then search for 'Maps to' using the CONCEPT\_RELATIONSHIP table

*** =feedbacks
- Wrong answer
- Wrong answer
- Well done!
- Wrong answer

--- type:PureMultipleChoiceExercise lang:sql xp:50 skills:1 key:c32cdad37f
## Drug Hierarchy (3)
In the previous exercise we found Clopidogrel as a drug product. We are now interested in the ingredient Clopidogrel and we like you to find this using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table.
Order your results by max\_levels\_of\_separation as in the figure below. 

<center><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/clopidogrel.png" alt="Clopidogrel" width="650" height="150"></center>


*** =possible_answers

## Athena

<p><img src="https://github.com/mi-erasmusmc/OMOP-CDM-Course/raw/master/img/Athena.png" alt="Athena" width="150" height="60"></p>

Finally, we like to make you aware of a very nice tool called ATHENA you can find <a href="http://athena.ohdsi.org" style="color:black">here</a>. This tool shows you the current vocabularies maintained by OHDSI and allows you to download it to populate your vocabulary tables. It will nicely archive all your previous downloads.

You can use Athena to browse the vocabulary, but note that this is the latest community version of the vocabulary which may be different from the one you are using in you local CDM. It does therefore not give you information about the record count.


Let's explore the searching functionality a bit because it does have some nice feature you may not be aware of. Search for 'type 2 diabetes' and use the filters on the left to show only the Standard Concepts in the domain 'Condition'. You see many standard codes here which represent different levels in the hierarchy. 

Search for '201826' and click on it. You can now see the hierarchy and related concepts retrieved from the vocabulary tables. 

Try to find some other concepts you are interested in and play around with the tool.

<b> Question: </b>

What is the ICD-10CM standard\_code for 'type 2 diabetes'? Can you find this by using filter or the hierarchy and related\_concepts information of the standard concept?


*** =possible_answers

- [E11]
- 1567956
- 250.00
- 201826
*** =hint


*** =feedbacks

- Correct
- This the concept\_id
- ICD-10CM?
- This is the standard concept\_id
