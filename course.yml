title: Fundamentals of the OMOP Common Data Model and Standardized Vocabularies
description: Healthcare data can vary greatly from one organization to the next. Data are collected for different purposes, such as provider reimbursement, clinical research, and direct patient care. These data may be stored in different formats using different database systems and information models. And despite the growing use of standard terminologies in healthcare, the same concept (e.g., blood glucose) may be represented in a variety of ways from one setting to the next.<p>This course aims to teach you the fundamentals of the OMOP Common Data
  Model (OMOP-CDM) and its Standardized Vocabularies. We will help you to better understand the conventions of the OMOP-CDM and its table
  structure. We start with an introductory video about the Observation Health Data
  Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative and will then dive into the OMOP-CDM
  and the Standardized Vocabularies.</p><p><center><img src="https://github.com/PRijnbeek/VocabularyCourse/raw/master/img/omop-cdm.png"
