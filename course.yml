title: OMOP Common Data Model and Standardized Vocabularies
description: This course aims to improve your understanding of the OMOP Common Data
  Model (OMOP-CDM) and its Standardized Vocabularies. Using very simple SQL queries
  we will help you to better understand the conventions of the OMOP-CDM and its table
  structure. We start with an introductory video about the Observation Health Data
  Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative and will then dive into the OMOP-CDM
  and the Standardize Vocabularies.<p><center><img src="https://github.com/PRijnbeek/VocabularyCourse/raw/master/img/omop-cdm.png"
